# ChipWhisperer lab return template 

## Level 2
### Inspecting power differences of operations
Tell which instructions were used and take screenshots from power trace and mark down the places where you think that you can see different instructions to be executed. You can draw those markings to pictures or tell those by your own words (for example: â€œFrom sample x to y target is running operation A and from y to z target runs operation B).

Replace the screenshot below with your own. Please have it roughly in the same scale.
X: ~800-1000 samples Y: ~0,3- -0,3
