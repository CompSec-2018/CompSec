## Labs

Labs have been split to 5 levels. Each level corresponds to the grade you will earn by completing that level

* Level 1: For level one you don't have to participate in the lab. You earn this by attendig lectures and filling a lecture diary of corresponding topic
* Level 2: Complete the bare minimum of the lab. You are expected to do this during lab hours
* Level 3: Complete the whole lab without extra work. You are expexted to do this during the lab hours but you are allowed to finish it on your own time
* Level 4: Complete the above and some extra work. It is likely that you don't have time to complete this during lab hours so you are expected to do this extra work on your own time, and return them to the assistants before the deadline
* Level 5: Complete all the above and the most challenging extra work. It is likely that you don't have time to complete this during lab hours so you are expected to do this extra work on your own time and return them to the assistants before the deadline

## Virtual machines used in the Labs

Each lab utilizes one or multiple virtual machines. These machines can be found from the University drive.

At least following operating systems will be used:

* Kali Linux - for Shellcoding, fuzzing and web security lab
* Ubuntu 16.04 - for Fuzzing, Botnets and malware analysis
* Lubuntu 16.04- Side-channel attacks with ChipWhisperer
